# Roadmap

This roadmap is the current project plan and issue tracker map for `fable-pyculator`.

The near-term direction is to build a FABLE Calculator-specific notebook/user-guide layer on top of
Modelwright-generated Python models while preserving Modelwright as the generic conversion engine.

## Current Next Steps

## Phase 0: Governance Bootstrap

GitHub parent issue: #1.

Initial commit: `8a5577d`.

Status: complete.

Goal: establish the repository contract, roadmap, changelog, planning area, package/docs/test
scaffold, benchmark metadata, reference-document handling, and artifact hygiene for FABLE Pyculator.
This phase wraps the current uncommitted scaffold as bootstrap evidence.

- [x] P0.1 Establish project overview and agent operating contract. Child issue: #2.
  - [x] Add `AGENTS.md` customized for FABLE Pyculator.
  - [x] Define the project boundary relative to Modelwright.
  - [x] Record source workbook, generated-model, and local artifact rules.
- [x] P0.2 Establish roadmap, changelog, planning area, and artifact rules. Child issue: #3.
  - [x] Add `ROADMAP.md`.
  - [x] Add `CHANGE_LOG.md`.
  - [x] Add `planning/README.md`.
  - [x] Keep workbook binaries, generated models, extracts, logs, and validation reports under ignored
        `tmp/`.
- [x] P0.3 Capture current package/docs/test scaffold as bootstrap evidence. Child issue: #4.
  - [x] Add package metadata and importable `fable_pyculator` module.
  - [x] Add selection-control discovery and notebook control records.
  - [x] Add output-table discovery and pandas rendering helpers.
  - [x] Add Sphinx documentation scaffold and FABLE workbook structure notes.
  - [x] Add benchmark metadata and checksums for the public FABLE-C workbooks.
  - [x] Track the public 2020 FABLE Calculator documentation PDF under `reference/`.
- [x] P0.4 Define strict GitHub issue, branch, and PR workflow. Child issue: #5.
  - [x] Mirror Modelwright's parent issue, child issue, feature branch, PR, and changelog workflow.
  - [x] Allow issue-number placeholders until the public remote and `gh` access exist.
  - [x] Require roadmap, changelog, issue comments, and verification evidence to stay synchronized
        after issue mapping is active.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim FABLE Pyculator has a documented agent-assisted development workflow.
- May claim the current scaffold discovers FABLE-C selection controls and output tables for the
  inspected public workbook structure.
- Must not claim stable public API compatibility, arbitrary FABLE country-calculator support,
  production FABLE-P readiness, or full generated-model equivalence.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `planning/README.md`.
- Added package scaffolding under `src/fable_pyculator/`.
- Added Sphinx documentation under `docs/`.
- Added public FABLE-C benchmark metadata under `benchmarks/fable-calculator/`.
- Added the public 2020 FABLE Calculator documentation PDF under `reference/fable-calculator/`.
- Downloaded the public 2019, 2020, and 2021 FABLE-C workbooks into ignored
  `tmp/private-workbooks/`.

Verification evidence:

- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` passed with `13` tests.
- `.venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W` passed.
- `sha256sum -c benchmarks/fable-calculator/checksums.sha256` passed for all three ignored workbook
  files.

Closeout evidence:

- Public GitHub repository: `UBC-FRESH/fable-pyculator`.
- Local `origin` remote points to `https://github.com/UBC-FRESH/fable-pyculator.git`.
- GitHub CLI installed locally under `~/.local/bin/gh` and authenticated as `gparadis`.
- Phase 0 parent and child issues created and mapped in this roadmap.
- Bootstrap commit pushed to `main`.

## Phase 1: FABLE-C Notebook Wrapper Maturation

GitHub parent issue: planned after Phase 0 closeout.

Status: planned.

Goal: turn the bootstrap selection-control and output-table discoveries into a coherent 2020 FABLE-C
notebook workflow that can drive a generated Modelwright model, render canonical outputs, and expose
clear user-guide examples.

- [ ] P1.1 Harden scenario selection control discovery. Child issue: planned.
  - [ ] Validate S.1 through S.16 on the 2020 workbook.
  - [ ] Confirm 2021 compatibility and document differences.
  - [ ] Keep 2019 as an older-structure fragility check.
- [ ] P1.2 Curate headline output indicators and figures. Child issue: planned.
  - [ ] Use `Indextables` and the canonical output sheets to select initial FOOD, LAND, GHG, and WATER
        headline outputs.
  - [ ] Render notebook-friendly pandas tables and matplotlib figures.
- [ ] P1.3 Build the first 2020 generated-model notebook loop. Child issue: planned.
  - [ ] Load or reference an ignored generated 2020 Modelwright model.
  - [ ] Apply selection-control overrides.
  - [ ] Render discovered output tables and curated headline outputs.
- [ ] P1.4 Add user-guide documentation and validation evidence. Child issue: planned.
  - [ ] Expand the Sphinx guide around scenario selection, running the model, and reading outputs.
  - [ ] Record 2020 benchmark evidence and 2021 follow-up scope.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim a coherent early FABLE-C notebook wrapper workflow for the inspected 2020 workbook.
- Must not claim production readiness or cross-country support until country-specific validation
  evidence is recorded.
